# Sentiment-Analysis-Twitter-word2vec-and-keras
A tweet sentiment classifier using word2vec and Keras. The combination of these two tools resulted in a 86% training accuracy and 73 % validation accuracy. This Keras model can be saved and used on other tweet data, like streaming data extracted through the tweepy API. There is so much scope to improve the model and implement it for different purposes involving sentiment analysis of twitter data.

*The dataset used here is a common dataset called sentiment140 found here: http://keenformatics.blogspot.in/2015/07/sentiment-analysis-lexicons-and-datasets.html*
